=========

light usenet client

### version

Lightnews is in prealpha version! (I hope it will be ready in... 1 week?)

```
def behappy():
	return ':-)'
```

### user interface

Lightnews will be operated in command-line style. Example:

```
 > help
   This program is...
   Author...
   Lincence...
 > addgroup server.name group.name
   Added group group.name on server.name
 >
```

### more?
